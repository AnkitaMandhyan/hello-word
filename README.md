Hi, I am Ankita Mandhyan. I am aspiring to become a Business Intelligence Analyst. I am currently learning online courses on Coursera. These courses are on Fundamentals of Vizualisation with Tableau and R programming. While going through the R programming course, I learnt about Vision control. It is great to know about Github and such interesting things available for programmers. I am very excited to learn more about Github and experience smooth programming.
Wohoo!
I have already learnt creating a respository. And,  here's my first branch edit. 
Let's see how it goes ahead.
